# kicad_mmccoo

Kicad's pcbnew has a built in python engine for automating tasks. Unfortunately, this scripting interface is not documented anywhere that I've been able to find. 

This is a repository to hold example and utility code in the hopes that others can learn to write their own scripts.

I have a [companion blog](https://kicad.mmccoo.com/)


If you get nothing else out of this repository, take a look at this UML diagram. It doesn't contain all available APIs; just the ones needed to do common tasks (the spec from which it was generated is in the plantuml subdirectory)
